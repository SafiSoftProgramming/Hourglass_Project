hey, guys how you doing...

you should do some small steps before uploading the code on Arduino.

1 - copy (Delay, LedControl) libraries from lib file and paste it in Arduino IDE libraries folder replace 
any existing file if any.

2 - make connections as showing in the connections image file.

3 - copy the code from the arduino_code.txt file and paste it into a new project or just open the project file 
in the Hourglass_project folder.

4 - verify the code and make sure that everything is ok.

5 - upload the code and enjoy the magic .
